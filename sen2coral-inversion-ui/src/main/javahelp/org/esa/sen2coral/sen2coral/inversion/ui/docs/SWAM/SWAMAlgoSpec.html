<h3>SWAM Processor</h3>

<p>
    The <u><b>S</b></u>hallow <u><b>W</b></u>ater <u><b>A</b></u>nalytical <u><b>M</b></u>odel has been
    developed by CNR-IREA. This processor computes the mapping habitats and depth
    by inversion of bio-optical models. It is based in a modified version of Sambuca
    (<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/winpython/files/WinPython_3.4/3.4.4.5">Semi-Analytical Model for Bathymetry, Un-mixing and Concentration Assessment</a>,
    M.Wettle & V. Brando, CSIRO Land and Water, 2006) and has been developed in Python. <br>
</p>


<p>
    'SAMBUCA is optimization-driven analytical model for estimating water column constituent
    concentrations, water column depth, and benthic substrate composition from remote sensing data.
    Based on an approach conceptualized by Lee et al. (1998, 1999, 2001), SAMBUCA was implemented
    in an IDL/ENVI environment. Following extensive testing and application of the approach to
    different data sets, several important modifications and improvements were made to the
    original Lee et al. (1998, 1999, 2001) approach. Notably, the optical parameterization of both
    the water column and the benthic substratum - fundamental properties of the model - were
    re-defined. Furthermore, features such as accessing spectral libraries of optical properties,
    allowing for more than one substratum to contribute to the remote sensing signal, and tracking
    the optical depth of a given system, were added.'

<h4>SWAM implementation in SNAP</h4><br>
<p>
    The SWAM algorithm has been implemented into SNAP with the following features:
<ul>
    <li>Developed in python.</li>
    <li>Requires Sambuca </li>
    <li>Highly configurable: input bands, relaxed constraints, error methods,
        shallow/not shallow...</li>
</ul>
</p><br>
<h5>Pre-requirements</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Python 3.4</li>
    <li>Sambuca </li>
    <li>Python configuration in SNAP</li>
</ul>
<p>See Installation <a href="../SWAMInstallationWindows.html">on Windows</a> for the recommended installation steps.</p>

<h5>SWAM User Interface</h5><br>
<p>
    The parameters described above can be set through the graphical user interface designed in the SNAP Desktop component:
</p>
<IMG SRC="../images/SWAM/SWAMUI.jpg">

<h5>Recommendations</h5>
<ul>
    <li>In each rrs (reflectance remote sensing) bands, needed in the computation,
        the spectral wavelength must be specified;
        to add the correct spectral wavelength right click on the
        band-->properties and modify the spectral wavelength fields,
        inserting the value of the central spectral wavelength of the band</li>
    <li>Delete all the spectral wavelengths values from bands that are not rrs
        (for example radiance or irradiance bands). Indeed the algorithm selects
        the bands, used in the computation, reading the spectral wavelength values. </li>
</ul>
